            TODO: how does translation work?
3 - example of backprop, how networks learn
    housing prices
    table of inputs and outputs
    TODO: get data, build visualization
4 - future work
    parallel processing
    more activation functions
    different types of layers
    better data transformation and normalization



Artificial Intelligence
    define intelligence: outputs from input, extrapolate data
    neural networks as Universal function approximators
what can networks do?
    general tasks - dense network
    deep fakes - image generation - gan
    translation - natrual language gen - transformer networks
    games - interactive environment - reinforcement learning
how do they work?
    demo
        squares of color -> whether its purple
        prep:
            get data - convert to HSV and get how close hue is to purple
            js visual
                colored boxes for input
                grayscale box for output
                neural network visualization with sliders
    introduce backpropogation
        research:
            good visuals for backprop? 3blue1brown?
            good explanations for the calc behind it? refer to og blog post
        TODO: consise explanation
