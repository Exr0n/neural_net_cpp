## Footnotes

\*Literally Everything:

By prediction, I mean any ML based model of the world. This is done in so many ways, but here are a few:
- Sentiment Analysis, probably with recurrent networks
- [Protien Folding architectures](https://deepmind.com/research/publications/AlphaFold-Improved-protein-structure-prediction-using-potentials-from-deep-learning)
- [Stock Market stuff with RL](https://medium.com/ether-labs/tradebot-stock-trading-using-reinforcement-learning-part1-8b67c9603f33) ([more](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-use-machine-learning-to-possibly-become-a-millionaire-predicting-the-stock-market-33861916e9c5), [links](https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-rich-quick-with-machine-learning-and-stock-market-predictions-696802da94fe))

And companies from advertising to entertainment use ad hoc classification models to recommend your content.
And vehicles use CNNs to decide whether to break. And doctors use the same tech to decide whether an X-ray image shows signs of disease.  
The list goes on and on.
